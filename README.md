# AI Training Architecture Prototype

This repository contains a prototype implementation for AI training architectures. The goal is to provide a flexible and scalable framework for experimenting with machine learning models and workflows.

---

## Requirements

### Environment
- Python **13.13.1** (ensure you have this version installed for compatibility)

### Dependencies
The project uses several Python packages to facilitate data processing, model training, and evaluation. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-training-prototype.git
cd ai-training-prototype
```

### Step 2: Install Python 13.13.1
Use your preferred version manager (e.g., `pyenv`) to install Python 13.13.1:

```bash
pyenv install 13.13.1
pyenv local 13.13.1
```

Ensure the correct version is active:

```bash
python --version
```
Output should be:
```
Python 13.13.1
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Project

### Training a Model

To train a model using the provided architecture:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Evaluate the Model

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

### Configurations

Model configurations, training parameters, and dataset paths can be modified in the `config.json` file.

### Running Tests

To ensure the project is functioning as expected, run the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/
```
